To get this project to compile properly please 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Import both assignment1 and google-play-services_lib
2. Right Click on Assignment -> Properties -> Android -> Library -> link google-play-services-lib
3. Run the project using an Android Google APIs Emulator
NOTE: 	1. Sometimes after linking eclipse will be wierd and show errors when building
		   if this happens please try restarting eclipse
		2. I have noticed the RMIT lab computers have issues with google play services
		   so the lat/long area may not work properly and ask you to manually enter
		   a lat/long
			


NOTE: My API key probably wont work so when you are viewing selecting a location
it will display blank tiles. What its meant to do is show you the location you searched 
for. However after you search for a location you will be able to tell it has worked
because the latitude/longitude location for the place you have searched will appear
below the blank map.
